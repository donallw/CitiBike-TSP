    "We will be conducting the traveling salesman problem on New York City citibike data. We will be using each CitiBike station as the nodes in our graph, and represent the edge costs by the average time it takes to bike from one station to another. Edges will only include those rides in the CitiBike data that have actually occurred - in other words, if no ride in the data started at station A and ended at station B, we will not include that edge. This adds to the realism of the problem as it would be unlikely to take that edge anyways. Moreover, we will only have edges from one station to another - not one station to itself, as there are occurences of rides like this in the CitiBike data."
